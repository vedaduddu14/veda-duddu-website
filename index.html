          <p>I’m a graduate student at UIUC working at the intersection of AI, language, and human-computer interaction. I care about making systems more legible, more humane, and more accountable — especially when they speak for us.</p>
          <p>Much of my work focuses on how people interact with AI systems in socially complex settings — from decision-making to communication. I'm especially interested in how we can design these systems to be more intuitive, context-aware, and genuinely useful in dynamic, real-world environments. </p>
          <p>More broadly, I’m drawn to questions around visibility, judgment, and access — who systems serve, who they overlook, and how we might shift those defaults.</p>
          <p> When I am not working, you can often find me experimenting in the kitchen, reading fanfictions and pursuing my efforts in becoming a polyglot (currently trying to learn Japanese). You can also see me tweet my life interspersed with random paper thoughts in my free-time.</p>
          <p>For questions, ideas, or just to say hi, feel free to get in touch. I’m always open to thoughtful conversations — you can reach out by email or connect with me below. </p>
